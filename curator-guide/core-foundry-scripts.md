# Core Foundry Scripts

./date\_type\_fixer.sh -cmd doc\_wrapper -c admin-Registry-test

if the date type errors are in the source collection. (-c option is only required for source collections) I thought I have already fixed source\_prog\_recs. What is the error requiring the date fix?

./date\_type\_fixer.sh -h usage: DateTypeFixer -c -cmd one of \[sources, source\_prog\_recs, doc\_wrapper] -h print this message
