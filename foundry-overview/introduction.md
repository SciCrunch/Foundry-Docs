# Introduction

## A message-oriented, horizontally scalable ETL system for scientific data integration and enhancement

Modern biomedical science involves the accrual of increasingly larger data sets in many forms. SciCrunch \([https://scicrunch.org](https://scicrunch.org/)\) lists &gt;2800 databases in its resource registry, spanning biological systems from the level of genes to behavior. We know that the amount of data that is easily discoverable and accessible relative to the amount produced or that which is required to comprehensively cover a domain is limited. Therefore, calls to add to public data must also be accompanied by platforms for making these data available, searchable and useful \(FAIR, a set of guiding principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable\)
