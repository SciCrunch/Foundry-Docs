# Useful Tools

This page lists a number of useful tools and resources for working with and in the Foundry Ecosystem

## [Postman](https://www.postman.com/#)

Postman is a collaboration platform for API development. Postman's features simplify each step of building an API and streamline collaboration so you can create better APIs. The [API Client](https://www.postman.com/product/api-client/) \(Free Tier\) allows you to quickly and easily send REST, SOAP, and GraphQL requests directly within Postman.

## [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)

Elasticsearch is a distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine capable of addressing a growing number of use cases. As the heart of the Elastic Stack, it centrally stores your data for lightning fast search, fineâ€‘tuned relevancy, and powerful analytics that scale with ease.

## [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)

MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud. MongoDB is a document database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents. We believe this is the most natural way to think about data, and is much more expressive and powerful than the traditional row/column model.
